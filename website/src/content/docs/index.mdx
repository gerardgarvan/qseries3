## Why qseries?

**Exact rational arithmetic** — every coefficient is computed as an exact fraction, never a floating-point approximation. Results you can trust for proofs and conjectures.

**Andrews' prodmake algorithm** — automatically convert any q-series into its infinite product representation. Identify Rogers-Ramanujan type identities at the push of a button.

**Theta, eta, and Jacobi products** — built-in support for `etaq`, `theta2`, `theta3`, `theta4`, `tripleprod`, `quinprod`, and more. Compute modular forms with ease.

**Relation finding** — discover polynomial and linear relations among q-series using `findhom`, `findnonhom`, and `findpoly`. Let the computer find the identities for you.

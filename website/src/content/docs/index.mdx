## A Taste of qseries

The Rogers-Ramanujan identity is one of the most celebrated results in partition theory:

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{q^{n^2}}{(q;q)_n} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1-q^{5n-1})(1-q^{5n-4})}$$

Verify it computationally in a single REPL session:

```text
qseries> rr := sum(q^(n^2)/aqprod(q,q,n,50), n, 0, 8)
1 + q + q^2 + q^3 + 2*q^4 + 2*q^5 + 3*q^6 + ... + O(q^50)

qseries> prodmake(rr, 40)
(1-q)^(-1) * (1-q^4)^(-1) * (1-q^6)^(-1) * (1-q^9)^(-1) * ...
```

The denominators appear only at exponents ≡ ±1 (mod 5) — the identity is confirmed.

## Background

qseries reimplements core functionality from Frank Garvan's
[qseries Maple package](https://qseries.org/fgarvan/qmaple/qseries/index.html)
as a standalone, zero-dependency C++ binary. It is designed for researchers in
partition theory, the theory of modular forms, and combinatorics.

The package provides tools for the three fundamental computational problems in
q-series research: converting series to infinite products, identifying eta and
Jacobi product representations, and discovering polynomial relations among
q-series.

## Get Started

qseries is free and open-source. Build from source with a single command — no
dependencies required.

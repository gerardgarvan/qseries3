## Why qseries?

**Exact rational arithmetic** — every coefficient is computed as an exact fraction, never a floating-point approximation. Results are mathematically rigorous to any requested truncation order.

**Andrews' prodmake algorithm** — convert any q-series into its infinite product representation. Recover the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, Euler's pentagonal theorem, and more from their series expansions.

**Theta and eta functions** — compute Jacobi theta functions θ₂, θ₃, θ₄, Dedekind's η(τ), and general (a; q)_∞ products. Identify eta-quotients and Jacobi product forms automatically with etamake and jacprodmake.

**Relation finding** — discover homogeneous and non-homogeneous polynomial relations among q-series using linear algebra over ℚ. Find identities that connect partition functions, modular forms, and combinatorial generating functions.
